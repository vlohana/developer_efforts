  <h1>CSS Display Property</h1>
  <div class="red">
    <p>Where can we find the courage to act in spite of fear? Trying to eliminate that which we react to
      fearfully is a fool’s errand because it locates the source of our fear outside ourselves, rather than within our
      own
      hearts.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="green">
    <p>Mobilizing others to achieve purpose under conditions of uncertainty— what leaders do—challenges
      the
      hands, the head, and the heart.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blue">
    <p>Organized collective action challenging the status quo—a social movement— requires leadership that
      goes far beyond a stereotypical charismatic public persona with whom it is often identified. Unable to rely on
      established bureaucratic structures for coordination, evaluation, and action, such action depends on voluntary
      participation, shared commitments, and ongoing motivation. Movements must mobilize under risky conditions not only
      because well-resourced oppositions often resist their efforts, but also because the undertaking itself is fraught
      with uncertainty about how—and whether—it can happen in the first place.</p>
